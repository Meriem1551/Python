if you want to leave the interective shell ctrl+z enter
to run a python file:
python filename.py
to return an integer in / we write x // y
age = 5
age + 5
to see type of variables : in terminal: type(varname)
arr[-number] from the end
arr[number] from the start
we can slice a string
str[s:e]//we dont include the e
we cant go from the end using negative num but we can do st[2: -1]
multiplying string by n means to repeat this string n times
we can join 2 lists by using + op
append methods does not return a new list; it modifies the existing list in place and returns None. 
if we have duplicated values and try to removing them using remove, it removed just the first one at the left
EX:
arr = [2,3,4,4,5,7,89,89]
arr.remove(89)
print(arr)  
            |
        <---|
    [2,3,4,4,5,7,89]
we can use multiple types in lists
we can append list inside a list
